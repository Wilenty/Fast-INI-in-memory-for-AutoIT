If you like my work, please support me.<br>
<br>
The idea to create this library came because AutoIT ini functions operates on ini file (which is slow), it means that the AutoIT ini functions reads and writes the ini file in every change.<br>
<br>
At program starts first you need to load the ini file into memory, and save the config ini before program closes itself, or when the user close configuration options.<br>
Save the ini file in every change does not brings desired effects, especially on slow HDDs and slow USB storage.<br>
<br>
Also, please check the examples I have prepared. They should shows how it works, what the possibilities are and how fast is the ini memory library.<br>
All functions and their result codes are described in a file named Functions_list.txt.<br>
<br>
Lately I tested all of the functions and made some corrections. From now it should works as expected.<br>
<br>
But, if you find a bug, please report it to me with details where this bug appears, that I can repeat it and find.<br>
The best will be, if you share with me the program, or script you are working on. Thanks!
